These directories contain scripts for converting papers that have been downloaded in markup language format (i.e., HTML or XML) into sentence-separated plain text files that CatMiner can extract data from. 

The test_set directory converts the 40 papers contained in our test set, introduced in the "Test set annotation" section, from which we extract our handmade database. 

The large_database directory converts the ~1000 papers targeted for extraction in the "Generation of an OCM database section".
