This script was used to retrieve our initial list of 1,794 DOIs listed in the "all_dois.csv" file. It functions by querying Scopus. However, because more articles are indexed by Scopus over time, the DOIs retrieved from this script will similarly change, making it inappropriate for reproducibility purposes. We thus decided to share it here in a separate folder. 

Note that to run this code, you must replace the word PLACEHOLDER with a valid Elsevier API key which can be requested for free on the developer portal [here](https://dev.elsevier.com/).
